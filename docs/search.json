      "contents": "\nSection 1: Generative Artwork\nArtwork 1: A Beautiful Twist \nArtwork 2: Set\nAblaze\nArtwork 3: Michigan Wolverines \nSection 2: GGRidges Extension\n\n\n\nThis is a density ridge plot from the ggridges extension that shows\nthe people’s exercise hours per week, split by their GPA category of\nlow, middle, and high. This data comes from GPAbySex, a subset of the\nStudentSurvey data set that surveyed introductory statistics students.\nThe colors on the graph correspond with the quantile that the data falls\ninto for that GPA category. The peak in the ridges show that the most\ncommon hours of exercise per week for each GPA category is around 5, and\nthat a larger portion of students with lower GPAs tend to work out\nmore.\nSection 3: Shiny App\nShiny App Link\n\nLawrence and I’s Shiny App allows users to adjust the confidence level\nof a sample and its sample size to produce 100 different confidence\nintervals. The data set that we used is NFL player salaries from the\n2019 season. The population mean salary for NFL players in 2019 is\naround 3 million dollars, which is what that black line represents. The\n100 intervals are plotted on this graph with the black dots in the\nmiddle representing their sample mean. If the color of the sample is\ngreen, then it contains the true mean. If it is red, it does not contain\nthe true mean. The accuracy number output represents the percentage of\nintervals that contained the true mean, and this number is approximately\nequal to the confidence level.\nSection 4: Other\nVisualizations\nGeom_Area\n\n\n\nThis graph comes from our second exam in the last section where we\nhad to try and recreate it. It uses geom_area and shows, by width, the\nnumber of deaths by the top 11 causes between 2015 and 2020. It uses the\nSpectral color palette and I think it makes the graph look very nice.\nHeart disease is the leading cause, with cancer right behind it. It also\nshows how massive of an effect COVID had as it appears out of nowhere\nbetween 2019 and 2020 and seems to have represented well over 300,000\ndeaths.\nGGAlluvial\n\n\n\nThis is an alluvial plot created using the ggalluvial extension. The\ndata set it is using is from a double blind trial for a new treatment\nfor arthritis where patients were either treated with a placebo or a\nreal treatment. This alluvial plot shows the portion of patients that\nreported feeling no improvement, some improvement, or marked\n(significant) improvement. It is a very visual plot that is easy to\nread, especially with the colors also matching up with the second axis.\nThe width of each band represents how many patients fell into that\ngroup, i.e. placebo patients who felt some improvement being the upper\nblue band.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "How Does Age Affect Hitters in Baseball?",
      "description": "In Major League Baseball, the average age of a player is around 28 years old and the average age of an MVP is right around the same number. However, current player ages range from early 20s to early 40s. If the MVP, who is presumably the best player of each league, is typically around 28 years old, does this mean older players are worse? Is the game getting younger for this reason? Through statistics and visualizations, we will try to find out how age affects professional baseball players' performances. Let's dive into the numbers!.",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n2021 MVP Candidates\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be looking at and comparing data from the 2016 MLB season and\n2021 MLB season, including hitting statistics from players with at least\n250 plate appearances. Our data sets consist of players’ names, age,\nvarious hitting statistics, and age group, split into young (<27),\nmiddle (27-31), and old (>31).\nFirstly, let’s see how the age groups are distributed between 2016\nand 2021:\n\n\n\nThis density bar chart shows the proportion comparisons between age\ngroups in 2016 and 2021.From it, we see that 2021 has less younger and\nolder players, but has a larger proportion of middle aged players. Is\nthere any reason why there were more middle aged players this past\nseason?\nLet’s take a look at the statistics of Batting Average and OPS to get\na look at the top hitters in these aspects:\n\n\n\nOPS and batting average are both valuable measurements of a player’s\nhitting ability. In 2021, most of the players with high OPS and AVG were\neither younger or middle aged players such as Vlad Guerrero Jr., Juan\nSoto, and Bryce Harper, while in 2016 there were more older players in\nthe mix like David Ortiz, Miguel Cabrera, and Joey Votto. From this, we\ncan see that the league’s top hitters have entered a new generation.\nHowever, these players could be outliers and may not represent the rest\nof the league, meaning the older players from 2021 could still play on\naverage with the younger ones.\nNow, let’s take a look at OPS across different age groups in the MLB\nfrom 2016 and 2021:\n\n\n\nThis visualization overlays box plots of players’ OPS from 2021 on\ntop of density ridge plots of players’ OPS from 2016. The colors in the\nlegend correspond with the quantile of data displayed by the ridge.\nHere, we see something interesting: the average OPS from older players\nhas not changed in this time, and the average OPS of middle and younger\naged players has actually decreased. We can see that the 50th percentile\non the ridges for middle and younger aged players in 2016 is higher than\nthe median from the 2021 data. After looking at this graphic, there\nappears to be no clear difference in OPS averages across the three age\ngroups in the MLB. We can see that there are outliers in the young and\nmiddle aged groups from 2021 with very high OPS, but as outliers, it is\nunreasonable to expect performances from these specific age groups every\nseason.\nOPS is not the only statistic that can tell us how valuable a player\nis. Let’s look at some other hitting statistics to see who tops the\nleader boards, such as home runs:\n\n\n\nIn this plot, each dot represents one player’s home run total for a\nseason, combining 2016 and 2021. The Violin Plot shows the HR totals\nwhere the bulk of hitters are hitting. The thick parts of the violin are\nthese areas. Across the board, similarly to OPS, each age group appears\nto hit the same amount of home runs on average.\nIf home runs and OPS are both consistently similar across each age\ngroup, are there any stats that are affected by age? Let’s look at a\ncorrelation plot to see how age correlates with the other\nstatistics:\n\n\n\nThis correlation plot shows how each statistic correlates with one\nanother, with a hotter square representing positive correlation and a\ncooler square representing negative correlation. The bottom row shows us\nhow age correlates with the rest of the statistics, and as you can see,\nthere is not much correlation between age and hitting, except for slight\npositive correlation with BB.Percent (walk percentage) and xOBP\n(expected on-base percentage) and slight negative correlation with\nK.Percent (strikeout percentage) and strikeouts.\nWalk percentage measures what percent of at-bats end in a walk and\nxOBP measures a player’s expected on-base percentage given the pitches\nand swings they take. If we plot walk percentage vs expected on-base\npercentage, we’ll get a better look at how age affects these two\ncategories.\n\n\n\nThis final plot shows the relationship between walk percentage, xOBP,\nand Age Group. The histogram on the top shows the distribution of\nplayers’ walk percentages, while the histogram on the right shows the\ndistribution of players’ xOBP. Lastly, the lines in the middle represent\neach age group’s line of best fit for these two stats. The older players\nhave the highest slope, indicating that they do have slightly higher\nwalk percentage and xOBP.\nConclusion:\nSo, what is the takeaway from all of these visualizations? Does age\nchange a player’s game? Are the younger MLB players outperforming the\nolder players? From what we have seen, my conclusion is that hitting\nstats do not change across age group. While I expected to see decreases\nin hitting performance from older players, this did not turn out to be\nthe case. So, while the league has less older players than it did back\nin 2016, the older ones still in the league are competing at the same\nlevel as all other ages. There may be some slight differences, such as\nolder players tending to draw more walks and reach base more often,\nthere is no significant differences that we discovered today. Sometimes,\nthe biggest discovery you can make from a data set is no discovery!\n\n\n\n",
